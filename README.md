# 🗳️ US Election Sentiment Analysis

> **Analyzing public opinion during the US Elections using Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, and Data Visualization.**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Elections are not just about numbers — they’re about **people’s voices, opinions, and emotions**.
This project dives deep into **Twitter/Reddit election-related conversations** to uncover the **sentiment polarity (positive, negative, neutral)** and explore how public mood shifts with political events.

The analysis leverages **Data Science + NLP** to provide insights into how **candidates, policies, and events** shaped public opinion during the election period.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Collect real-world election-related tweets/posts.
* Preprocess raw text (remove noise, hashtags, mentions, stopwords).
* Perform **Sentiment Analysis** using NLP and ML techniques.
* Build classification models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, Deep Learning).
* Visualize results with engaging plots & dashboards.
* Derive insights about **public perception of candidates/parties**.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Languages**: Python 🐍
* **Libraries/Frameworks**:

  * Data Handling: `pandas`, `numpy`
  * NLP: `nltk`, `spacy`, `TextBlob`, `transformers` (BERT)
  * Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`, `wordcloud`
  * ML/DL: `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `tensorflow/keras`
* **Data Sources**: Twitter API, Reddit API, Kaggle datasets
